# codacore

This repo contains the code for reproducing the results from our paper [Learning Sparse Log-Ratios For High-Throughput Sequencing Data"](add_arxiv_link).

If you would simply like to access and/or download an up-to-date implementation of CoDaCoRe, check [py-codacore](https://github.com/egr95/py-codacore) (for python users) or [R-codacore](https://github.com/egr95/R-codacore) (for R users).
