The input data can be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/record/3893986#.YCX9Qs9Kg-Q, and https://www.refine.bio/search?q=GSE68086, and should be placed in two separate subfolders, one for the 25-dataset benchmarks, and another for the liquid biopsy data. Note the 25-dataset collection (first link) includes all the files in the subfolders, 'dba-data' and 'mlrepo-data', in the first link.
